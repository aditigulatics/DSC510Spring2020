# name: Jessica Black
# this program will do the following:
# Display a welcome message for your user
# Retrieve the company name from the user
# Retrieve the number of feet of fiber optic cable to be installed from the user
# Calculate the installation cost of fiber optic cable by multiplying the total cost as the number of feet times $0.87
# Print a receipt for the user including the company name, number of feet of fiber to be installed, the calculated cost, and total cost in a legible format.

# One - Display welcome message
user_name = input('Hello, user! We are glad you are here. What is your name?')
print(f'Welcome, {user_name}')


# Two - Retrieve Company Name
Company_Name = input('What is your company name?:\n')
print(f'Welcome {Company_Name}')


# Three - Retrieve the number of feet of fiber optic cable to be installed from the user
Cable_Length = input('How much feet of fiber optic cable needs to be installed?\n')
# I chose a random amount of 55 feet

# Four - Installation cost (feet x $.087)
# Length of cable to be installed (x) = 55; (y) = .87
# Installation Cost = 47.85

y = 0.87
x = 55

Price = 0.87
Quantity = 55
Installation_Cost = (Quantity)*(Price)

print(f'{Cable_Length} feet of cable needs to be installed.')
f' ("The cost per foot is .87.")'
f" (\"The total installation cost will be {Installation_Cost}\")"

#5 Print Receipt

print(f'Thank you, {user_name} from {Company_Name} for your recent purchase. This notice serves as your receipt.' '\n'
      f'\n'
      f'Your total installation cost for {Cable_Length} feet of fiber optic cable at a cost of $.87/foot is $ {Installation_Cost}'
      f'\n'
