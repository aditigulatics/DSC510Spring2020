Desc: The program will get current weather data for the City.
It has two methods -
get_weather_data â€“ Parameter to the method is valid city. Returns weather data as received from OpenWeather API.
get_time_in_readable_format - converts UTC time into readable format.
process_weather - processes response from weather API. Creates weather object and
                  calls print_weather to print weather information in structured format.

Weather class is blue print of weather object and has class method print_weather.

User can request weather for a city multiple times before they quit by pressing Q/q.
