#Algoritham to create a program which performs three essential operations
#Open the file and process each line.
#Either add each word to the dictionary with a frequency of 1 or update the wordâ€™s count by 1.
#Nicely print the output, in this case from high to low frequency.

#Program to perform processing the line by adding each word to the dictionary.
#Once values are added need to format as list to sort the values by desc.
